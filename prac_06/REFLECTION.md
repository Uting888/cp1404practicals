# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have started breaking tasks into smaller, manageable steps and testing my code more frequently, which helps me identify and fix errors earlier. I also make better use of version control to keep track of changes.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to improve my time management by starting practicals earlier in the week instead of leaving them close to the deadline. I also want to spend more time reviewing lecture content before starting the practical tasks.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I actively use the provided code examples and documentation to guide my solutions. I also make sure to follow PEP 8 style guidelines, which makes my code cleaner and easier to read.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop rushing through tasks just to complete them and instead focus on understanding the underlying concepts. I also want to avoid skipping the “reflection” parts, as they help consolidate my learning.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I would like more real-world case studies or small projects that show how the concepts we learn are applied in industry, especially involving collaborative coding and version control.

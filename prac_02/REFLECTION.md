# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

60%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I usually watch lecture videos at night, but I missed some classes, I’m still catching up and haven’t followed a consistent schedule.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

When watching lecture videos, I try to deeply understand every concept instead of skipping over parts I don’t understand. I also take the time to explore the code in detail.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I tend to spend too much time figuring things out on my own when I get stuck, which slows me down significantly. I need to start asking for help earlier or move on and come back later, so I can keep up with the weekly pace.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I haven’t been able to complete my practical work on time due to falling behind in lectures. I plan to prioritise catching up with core content and set a more realistic pace for finishing tasks.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I carefully work through each part of the practicals when I do them, making sure I understand the logic behind the code. I don’t copy blindly and take pride in figuring things out myself.
